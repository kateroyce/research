#Introduction

### Time series

A good introduction `r citep('10.1093/ije/dyt092')` has information about common time series tests in epidemiology, as well as sample code for the analyses they suggest.

- Time series: a sequence of data points recorded at regular time intervals. Units are of time, such as days, and underlying population size doesn't matter because it won't change on a short timescale.

- Short timescales are more likely to illuminate causal relationships because they exclude systematic patterns (such as seasons)

### Chaos

[This journal](http://www.cmsim.eu/) is all about chaotic modelling! (Note: this is probably also what edgy fashionistas have as their Twitter bio)
