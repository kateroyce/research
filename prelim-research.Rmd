#Introduction

### Time series

A good introduction `r citep('10.1093/ije/dyt092')` has information about common time series tests in epidemiology, as well as sample code for the analyses they suggest.

- Time series: a sequence of data points recorded at regular time intervals. Units are of time, such as days, and underlying population size doesn't matter because it won't change on a short timescale.

- Short timescales are more likely to illuminate causal relationships because they exclude systematic patterns (such as seasons)

### Chaos

The avian influenza paper `r citep('10.1016/j.mbs.2013.09.001')` hints at chaos.

This introductory paper `r citep('10.1088/0143-0807/26/1/021')` explains how to find chaos in time series. Also check out `r citep('10.1088/0143-0807/26/4/003')`

[This journal](http://www.cmsim.eu/) is all about chaotic modelling! (Note: this is probably also what edgy fashionistas have as their Twitter bio)

For some reasons my predecessors in Math 53 have written the first [search result](https://math.dartmouth.edu/archive/m53f09/public_html/proj/Jon_writeup.pdf) that comes up when one googles "chaos epidemiology".

Dartmouth strikes again with Lorenz's paper `r citep('10.1175/jas3430.1')` on how to create chaotic models.


And finally, it's funny that one of the foundational papers `r citep('10.2307/2318254')` dismisses epidemiology on the first page.
